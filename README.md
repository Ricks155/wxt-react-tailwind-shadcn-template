## Usage

This template is designed for building Chrome extensions. After setting up the project, you can start developing your extension by modifying the files in the `src` directory. The key components to focus on include:

- **Popup Component**: This is where your extension's main UI will reside.
- **Background Scripts**: Handle background tasks and events.
- **Content Scripts**: Interact with web pages.

### Dark Mode

To toggle between light and dark modes, you can use the built-in theme switcher. The toggle button is included in the main UI. This allows users to customize their experience based on their preferences.

### Hot Reloading

While developing, hot reloading will automatically refresh the extension in the browser when you save changes. This feature significantly speeds up the development process.
